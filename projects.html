          As human space exploration missions venture further into the solar
          system, it is expected that the crew will have limited support from
          Earth’s mission control; forcing crewmembers to be highly reliant on
          each other as well as their spacecraft. This on-going project investigates
          the use of wearables as method for monitoring the crewmembers operational
          state and predicting performance outcomes on various tasks. </p>

      <h2 class="projectTitle"> Space Laundry System </h2>

      <div class = "projectDescription">
        <p class="projectDescriptionText">The ZeoWash<span class="sup">&reg;</span> laundry system has
        designed and built to service laundry in hostile environments, such as
        for spaceflight, off-grid applications, remote locations. It combines a low power
        thermoelectric condenser and desiccant dehydrator with a tumble
        agitator to produce a convenient all-in-one laundry system. The system
        sanitizes and de-soils used clothing,
        garments, and linens. ZeoWash’s compact design and low profile allows
        it to fit in volume-constrained areas and requires minimal personnel
        time. The system reduces overall mass through efficient reclamation of
        wash water in a hybrid liquid counterweight tuned mass damper subsystem
        to remove the need for heavy concrete counterweights.</p>

          As human spaceflight systems become more complex, versatile, and
          interconnected, the need to better understand interactions between the
          human and spacecraft increases.This project developed a computational model
          for comparing various spacecraft design components and simulated spaceflight missions
          as a method for comparing outcomes of design selections.</p>
